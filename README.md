# Autoencoder
unsupervised learning of an autoencoder

The aim of this folder is to explore the unsupervised learning of an autoencoder. Also
we should explore how noise and size of latent space affected reconstruction capabilities of the
net. The main steps I go through were:
• creation of k-fold function and some noise source for the testing phase;
• creation of a net model;
• training of the model through the 3-fold cross validation(file hw4.py);
• test of differentmodel reconstruction skills (file different-test.py);
For the last step, it was used different net, already trained in different session with the last part
of the code in file hw4.py.
